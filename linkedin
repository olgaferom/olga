📌 ABOUT ME

Biologist by training, educator by passion, and relentless explorer of how technology can transform healthcare and education.

As Co-Founder of AI, Drugs & Robots (@aidrugsyrobots), I've built a community of 205,000+ followers who trust us to understand the future of science, technology, and medicine. What started as sharing innovation news in a WhatsApp group with friends, has evolved into a platform where we create educational content about AI, health, and technology—adapted for each social media format—while managing a WhatsApp community of nearly 2,000 members organized across 10+ thematic groups.

Currently building aprenderIA (aprenderia.es), an online academy democratizing access to AI knowledge in Spanish. As Co-Founder, Education Director, and Social Media Director, I'm designing courses launching in early 2026.

My background includes teaching at the Master's level (Genetics, Genomics, and Cell Biology), coordinating national healthcare vocational programs, and hands-on biomedical research during my MSc in Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology. I've also led teams of up to 100 people as Event Operations Coordinator for Atlético de Madrid, bringing project management skills from high-pressure sports and cultural environments.

As Cursor AI Community Ambassador for UAE and Middle East, I organize hackathons, meetups, and collaborative spaces for developers and AI enthusiasts in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. I also collaborate as a Freepik AI Partner, testing beta tools and bridging feedback between developers and real users.
